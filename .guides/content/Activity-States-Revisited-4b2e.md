Just like an activity, a fragment has a number of key lifecycle methods that get called at particular times. It’s important to know what these are and when they get called so your fragment works in just the way you want.

Fragments are contained within and controlled by activities, so the fragment lifecycle is closely linked to the activity lifecycle. Here’s a reminder of the different states an activity goes through, and on the next page we’ll show you how these relate to the fragment.
