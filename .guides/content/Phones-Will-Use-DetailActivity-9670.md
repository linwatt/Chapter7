We’re going to create a second activity called `DetailActivity`. This activity will contain `WorkoutDetailFragment`, and will be used by phones to display details of the workout the user selects.

Use the Android Studio New Activity wizard to create a new blank activity called *DetailActivity.java* with a layout called *activity_detail.xml*. This layout needs to be in the *app/src/main/res/layout* folder so that any device can use it.
