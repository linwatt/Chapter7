We’ll start by updating the layout code for the fragment. Open the file fragment_workout_detail.xml in the app/src/res/layout folder, and replace its contents with the code below:

As you can see, fragment layout code looks just like activity layout code. This is a very simple layout made up of two text views: a text view with large text to display the name of the workout, and a text view with smaller text to display the workout description. When you write your own fragment layout code, you can use any of the views and layouts you’ve already been using to write activity layout code. 

Now that we’ve created a layout for our fragment to use, we’ll look at the fragment code itself.
