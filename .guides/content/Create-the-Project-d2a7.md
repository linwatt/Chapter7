Create a new Android project the same way as the previous chapters.

Name the project 'Workout'
Package name: com.hfad.workout

The minimum SDK should be at least API 17, since we'll be using this app in later chapters

Specify 'MainActivity' with a layout of 'activity_main' so your code matches ours.
