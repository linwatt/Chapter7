We’ll start by adding the `Workout` class to the app.
*Workout.java* is a pure Java class file that the app will get workout data from. The class defines an array of four workouts, where each workout is composed of a name and description. Add the class to the *com.hfad.workout* package in the *app/src/main/java* folder in your project, giving it a class name of `Workout`. Then save your changes.

The data will be used by the fragment `WorkoutDetailFragment`. We’ll create this fragment next.
