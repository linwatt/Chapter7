Now that we’ve got `WorkoutDetailFragment` working, we need to create a second fragment that contains a list of the different workouts. We’ll then be able to use the fragments to create different user interfaces for phones and tablets.

You've already seen how to add a list view to an activity. We can create a fragment that contains a single list view, and then update it with the names of the workouts.

When we wanted to use an activity that contained a single list, we used a `ListActivity`. Is there something similar for fragments?
