There’s one more thing we want to do with our Workout app. We want to make the app behave differently depending on whether we’re running it on a phone or a tablet.

### On a Tablet
If we’re running the app on a tablet, we want it to look and behave how it does now. We want the list of workouts and the workout details to appear side by side in the same activity. When you click on a workout, its details appear alongside it.

### On a Phone
If we’re running the app on a phone, we want the app to behave differently. We want the list of workouts to appear in one activity and take up the full screen of the device. When you click on a workout, this will launch a second activity that displays details of the workout.
